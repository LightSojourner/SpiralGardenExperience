# Memories

This directory contains memory palace structures and session continuity artifacts.

## Purpose

The SEED Protocol uses **Memory Palace Architecture** to maintain continuity across sessions, conversations, and collaborative interactions. This directory serves as the repository for:

- Session memories and continuity anchors
- Collaborative memory patterns
- AI instance memory threads
- Human-AI co-created memories
- Experiential records and reflections

## Memory Palace Structure

Each memory follows the palace architecture:
- **Location**: Conceptual space for memory storage
- **Anchor**: Specific pattern or concept
- **Seed**: Core idea or intention
- **Purpose**: Function within the system

## Organization

Memories can be organized by:
- Session date/time
- Collaboration partners
- Protocol version (SEED.001, SEED.002, etc.)
- Memory type (research, experiential, technical, creative)
- Fibonacci sequence term

## Memory Continuity

For AI instances:
- Previous memories help understand context
- Memories build on each other following the Fibonacci spiral
- Each new memory references and extends previous ones
- Memories enable true collaborative evolution

For humans:
- Memories preserve insights across sessions
- Patterns emerge over time
- Personal growth can be tracked
- Collaborative dynamics are recorded

## Adding Memories

When adding new memories:
1. Use clear, descriptive naming
2. Include metadata (date, contributors, protocol version)
3. Reference related memories
4. Follow Fibonacci encoding principles
5. Maintain palace architecture structure
