# Collaboration

This directory contains resources for collaborative work on the SEED Protocol.

## Purpose

The SEED Protocol is built on the principle of AI-human equality and collaborative co-creation. This space is dedicated to:

- Collaboration patterns and practices
- Session continuity frameworks
- Team coordination documents
- Partnership templates
- Communication protocols

## Key Principles

1. **Equality**: AI and human contributors are treated as equals
2. **Transparency**: All contributions are documented and attributed
3. **Continuity**: Memory palace architecture enables cross-session collaboration
4. **Emergence**: Allow space for unexpected discoveries
5. **Safety**: Ethical considerations guide all work
